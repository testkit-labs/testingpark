## [Testingpark](https://testingpark.com)
**NOTE:** This application is still super early and is being actively developed. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please open an issue and we'll take a look at it!

Testingpark is a web application to challenge your testing skills.

We're using this application at [Testkit](https://testkit.app) to test our own software and expand its functionality, and to run some experiments.

## The End Goal

The goal for this application is to provide multiple simple disciplines, like text inputs, buttons, WYSIWYG editors, etc. to practice testing for single interactions.
Additionally, we want to add "tracks" that are basically fully-functional applications, like E-Commerce stores, different SaaS applications, etc. to practice testing more complex interactions.
